# Cheryls-ETL-Pipelines

## 1. Project Overview
This project provides an ETL pipeline developed in python 3 that fetches commit data from the apache/airflow github repository using the GitHub API. The data is processed, stored in an SQLite database, and analyzed for insights such as top committers and commit patterns.

## 2. Usage of `ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) File
All code and documentation for this project are stored in the `ipynb` file. The reason for using this format is to combine both development and documentation in one place. The notebook allows for running code, analyzing results, and documenting the process in real time. It serves as both the development environment and a comprehensive guide for understanding the logic and functionality of the project.

## 3. How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Download or Clone the Repository
You can either download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using Git:

- **Clone with Git:**
  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
- **Download ZIP:**  
Go to the repository on GitHub and click the "Download ZIP" button.

### Step 2: Run the Jupyter Notebook
Once the repository is downloaded or cloned, navigate to the folder containing the `ipynb` file and run it:

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter interface/Google Colab/any IDE of your choice.

2. Run the cells to execute the code and follow the documentation within the notebook to understand the steps and logic of the pipeline.

## 4. Locate Documentation
The complete documentation for this project is located within the `ipynb` file itself. It includes explanations of the code, steps in the ETL pipeline, and detailed insights into how the project works. If you prefer a static version, a `PDF` version of the notebook is also available. Both versions contain the same documentation and can be used interchangeably. Simply open either of the files to view the documentation alongside the code.
